# Shared Health Record
Proof of Concept Environment Setup

# Components

## OpenMRS EMR
### Host URLs
- openmrs-server: http://localhost:8091/openmrs
- openmrs-db: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3308/openmrs
- fhir metadata: http://localhost:8091/openmrs/ws/fhir2/R4/metadata?_format=json

### Links
- https://github.com/pmanko/docker-openmrs-server

### Notes
- Server container requires restart after initial setup for some reason. 
- Ran into issues with DB character set (https://talk.openmrs.org/t/ui-framework-error-while-attempting-to-access-registration-app/8734/6).
  Had to specify characterset and collation in docker setup.
- To create demo patients, you can set the `OMRS_CONFIG_ADD_DEMO_DATA` variable in the `openmrs/refapp/openmrs-server.env` file
  or set the `createDemoPatientsOnNextStartup` global property to the number of patients you want to create and restart the 
  container.

#### Notes
- Ran into issues with setting up Postgres due to DDL error for some table creation - the 
  generated DLL included "blob". WOndering if we can use this script which uses `oid`. Reverting to mysql f
  for now. (solved: dialect set twice ::sigh:: )

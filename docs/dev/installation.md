!!! warning
    This guide is for demonstrations or tests only, not for production environments.

!!! note
    This installation method requires familiarity with the command line.

## Prerequisites

* CPU/RAM: Modern CPUs with 8GB RAM.
* Java version 8 (1.8). Oracle-licensed Java (requires sign-in) and [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net) (not sign-in required) have been tested.
* [Node 10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) which includes npm.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## HAPI FHIR Server CLI

For non-production environments, the HAPI maintainers provide a simple CLI-based tool to run it.

The only required dependency is Java >= 8 (1.8).

See [HAPI FHIR CLI](https://smilecdr.com/hapi-fhir/docs/tools/hapi_fhir_cli.html) for instructions for the OS of choice.

The Client Registry requires FHIR version R4 and HAPI must be started for this version. To run HAPI:
```
hapi-fhir-cli run-server -v r4
```

The HAPI Web Testing UI is available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) The Web Testing UI should be disabled for production. It allows the viewing of any resource on the server.

The FHIR Base URL is at [http://localhost:8080/baseR4/](http://localhost:8080/baseR4/)

Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to ensure HAPI is up and running or
```sh
curl -X GET "localhost:8080/baseR4/Patient?"
```

## ElasticSearch

Install and start ES for the intended OS. See the [ES install instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)

The required version is >=7.6.

The phonetic analysis package must be installed. For example:
```
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-phonetic
```

The string similarity plugin must be installed. See: https://github.com/intrahealth/similarity-scoring


Once installed and started, ensure that ES is up and running:
```sh
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/health?v&pretty"
```
Status should be yellow for a single-node cluster.


## OpenCR Service and UI

Clone the repository into a directory of choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/intrahealth/client-registry.git
```

Enter the server directory, install node packages.
```
cd client-registry/server
npm install
```

Copy and edit the configuration file to your liking.
```
cp config/config_development_template.json config/config_development.json
# edit the servers...
```

The minimum changes to start a running standalone system are:

* Change `fhirServer.baseURL` to "http://localhost:8080/baseR4/"

Run the server from inside client-registry/server:
```
# from client-registry/server
sudo NODE_ENV=development node lib/app.js
```

* Visit the UI at: [https://localhost:3000/crux](https://localhost:3000/crux)
    * **Default username**: root@intrahealth.org 
    * **Default password**: intrahealth

OpenCR may require access to /var/log for logging. This requirement may be changed in the future.

Congratulations! Now it's time to run a [query](queries.md).

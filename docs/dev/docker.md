# Local Installation using Docker

!!! warning
    This guide is for demonstrations or tests only, not for servers or production environments.

The easiest way to get started with OpenCR is to use Docker to launch ElasticSearch and HAPI FHIR Server and run the OpenCR Service directly. By running the OpenCR Service directly, it is easy to revise and reload decision rules.

These instructions have been tested on Linux and macOS.

!!! note
    This installation method requires some familiarity with the command line.

## Prerequisites

* Any modern PC capable of running Docker for Desktop. 
    * macOS: 2010 and newer Macs. macOS 10.13 or later (Sierra, Mojava, Catalina).
    * Windows 10 64-bit (Education, Pro, or Enterprise). Note that you must have Hyper-V and Containers Windows enabled and these require administrator privileges.
* 8GB RAM on the computer is recommended. ElasticSearch and HAPI FHIR Server will use up to 1GB of RAM. OpenCR Service will use less than 200MB RAM.
* Docker for Desktop
* [Node 10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) which includes npm.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Instructions

* Clone the repository and change directory into the root folder.
```
https://github.com/intrahealth/client-registry.git
cd client-registry
```

* Ensure that Docker is installed and running.
```
docker --version
```

* Start ElasticSearch and HAPI FHIR Server using Docker. 

!!! warning 
    You cannot use the existing hosted ElasticSearch image because OpenCR requires two plugins to be installed. The docker-compose file provided uses the Dockerfile-es which builds an ES image with the plugins.
```
docker-compose up fhir es
```

* Switch to a new terminal window. Install the requirements for the OpenCR Service.
```
cd server
npm install
```

* Copy a configuration for Docker for the OpenCR Service to use.
```
cp config/config_docker_template.json config/config_docker.json
```

* Run the server using the docker config for NODE_ENV.
```
# from client-registry/server
sudo NODE_ENV=docker node lib/app.js
```

* Visit the UI at: [https://localhost:3000/crux](https://localhost:3000/crux)
    * **Default username**: root@intrahealth.org 
    * **Default password**: intrahealth

OpenCR may require access to /var/log for logging. This requirement may be changed in the future.

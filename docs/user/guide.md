# OpenHIE Implementation Guide

Implementation processes are complex. The OpenHIE Client Registry Subcommunity is a valuable resource for understanding the policies and practices of client registries, particularly in low resource settings. [Visit their site](https://ohie.org/client-registry/).

The community provides a comprehensive resource, [The Client Registry Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AwOm1oErLoJ7pyI7ouc_m7AsMInscHL7whmnKzIIsGk), may be consulted for the overall processes required to implement, including how to:

* Analyze the current environment
* Establish leadership and governance
* Document specifications and requirements
* Implement specifications
* Create a support plan
* Conduct a post-production evaluation

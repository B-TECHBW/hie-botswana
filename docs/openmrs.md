## Installing the Module

OpenCR can be setup to work with OpenMRS with the MPI module. There is a reference implementation for 2.x and legacy OpenMRS to connect to the CR. The branch must be chosen correctly.

* [2.x support](https://github.com/santedb/openmrs-module-mpi-client/tree/2x_support)
* [Legacy support](https://github.com/santedb/openmrs-module-mpi-client/tree/fhirimpl)
